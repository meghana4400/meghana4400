# Hi there, I'm Meghana Garaga 👋

## Data Analyst | Data Engineer | AI Enthusiast

I am a Microsoft-Certified Data Professional with 4 years of experience in Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning. My expertise lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights, designing scalable data systems, and delivering innovative solutions that drive business value.

As a child, I was captivated by the intricacies of Sudoku, the challenge of word-building games like Scrabble, and strategic puzzles that demanded both creativity and logical thinking. These games sparked my passion for data science, where, much like piecing together a puzzle, I break down massive datasets and apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world challenges.

This evolution from solving childhood puzzles to solving data problems in the real world continues as I refine my expertise at Georgia State University, always seeking opportunities to apply AI and Big Data in innovative ways that drive meaningful outcomes.
